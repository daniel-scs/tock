Tock Getting Started Guide
==========================

This covers how to get the toolchain setup on your platform to start using and
developing Tock.

## Requirements

1. [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) (nightly)
2. [arm-none-eabi toolchain](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/) (version >= 5.0)
3. stormloader (recommended) or JLinkExe for programming the storm
4. Command line utilities: wget, sed, make

### Installing Requirements

#### Rust (nightly)

We are using `rustc 1.16.0-nightly (83c2d9523 2017-01-24)`. We recommend
installing it with [rustup](http://www.rustup.rs) so you can manage multiple
versions of Rust and continue using stable versions for other Rust code:

```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

This will install `rustup` in your home directory, so you will need to
source `~/.profile` or open a new shell to add the `.cargo/bin` directory
to your `$PATH`.

Then override the default version of Rust to use for Tock by running the
following from the top-level Tock directory:

```bash
$ rustup override set nightly-2017-01-25
```

#### `arm-none-eabi` toolchain

We are currently using arm-none-eabi-gcc version 5.4 from the gcc-arm-embedded
PPA on launchpad. Using pre-5.0 versions from that repo, or other versions
packaged with a newlib version earlier than 2.3 will run into problems with
missing ARM intrinsics (e.g., `__aeabi_memclr`).

##### Mac OS X

With [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (preferred):

```bash
$ brew tap ARMmbed/homebrew-formulae
$ brew update
$ brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

or with [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/):

```bash
$ port install arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

###### Heads Up!

The `make debug` target asks the Tock build system to generate a listings
(disassembly) file. Some developers have noticed that `arm-none-eabi-objdump`
takes a long time (order several minutes) on a mac while Activity Monitor
reports that `opendirectoryd` pegs the CPU.

This is a [known issue](http://superuser.com/questions/350879/) that you can
resolve by commenting out the `/home` line from `/etc/auto_master` and then
running `sudo automount -vc` to apply the changes.

##### Linux

On Linux we recommend getting packages from the [Launchpad repo](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download).

###### Compiled Binaries

```bash
$ curl https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/5.0/5-2016-q2-update/+download/gcc-arm-none-eabi-5_4-2016q2-20160622-linux.tar.bz2
```

If you install the binaries but get a "no such file or directory" error
when trying to run them, then you are most likely missing needed libraries.
Check that you have a 64-bit version of libc installed.

###### Ubuntu

```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:team-gcc-arm-embedded/ppa
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-embedded
```

###### Arch

On Arch Linux the `arm-none-eabi` package in pacman contains a sufficiently up
to date version of newlibc.

##### Windows

For Windows and other operating systems, download site is
[here](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download).

##### Other

Alternatively, if you would like simulator mode in `arm-none-eabi-gdb`,
you can use the build scripts in the `tools` directory, in this order:
`build-arm-binutils` then `build-arm-gcc` then `build-arm-gdb`.

## Compiling the Kernel

To build the kernel, just type `make` in the root directory.  The root
Makefile selects a board and architecture to build the kernel for and
routes all calls to that board's specific Makefile. The root Makefile
is set up with the following defaults:

```
TOCK_BOARD ?= storm
TOCK_ARCH ?= cortex-m4
```

so it compiles for the storm board. There are two ways to build
for a different board

 * You can compile the kernel for a specific board by running the command
   from inside the board's directory

    ```bash
    $ cd boards/nrf51dk/
    $ make
    ```

 * Alternatively, you can add an environment variable for the
  `TOCK_BOARD` and `TOCK_ARCH`.
    `TOCK_BOARD` is the directory name inside `boards/`.
    `TOCK_ARCH` is the gcc architecture name. Ex: `cortex-m4` or `cortex-m0`.

    ```bash
    $ make TOCK_BOARD=nrf51dk TOCK_ARCH=cortex-m0
    ```

Board specific Makefiles are located in `boards/<BOARD>/`. Some boards have
special build options that can only be used within the board's directory.
Generic options such as `clean`, `doc`, `debug`, `program`, and `flash` can be
accessed from Tock's root

## Uploading the Kernel

To upload code to a board, use `make program` or `make flash` (recommended).

  * `flash` programs the chip using JTAG, which is a debugging and
    control protocol that many chips provide. This requires that the
    board either supports JTAG directly (e.g., the nrf51dk) or you
    connect a JTAG device to the board (e.g., imix and storm).

  * `program` uploads code over a serial bootloader. Your computer sends
    the image over the serial port to a small piece of code running on the
    board, which writes the image to the chip's flash. Not all platforms
    support this option.


## Compiling applications

All user-level code lives in the `userland` subdirectory. This
includes a specially compiled version of newlib, a user-level library
for talking to the kernel and specific drivers and a variety of
example applications.

Compiled applications are architecture-specific (e.g.  `cortex-m4`,
`cortex-m0`) since the compiler emits slightly different instructions
for each variant. Compiled applications can also depend on specific
drivers, which not all boards provide; if you load an application onto
a board that does not support every driver/system call it uses, some
system calls with return error codes (ENODEVICE or ENOSUPPORT).

The `TOCK_ARCH` environment variable controls which chip architecture
to compile to. You can set the `TOCK_ARCH` to any architecture GCC's
`-mcpu` option accepts. By default, `TOCK_ARCH` is set to `cortex-m4`
for the `storm` board.

To compile an app, `cd` to the desired app and `make`. For example:

```bash
$ cd userland/examples/blink/
$ make
```

This will build the app and generate a binary in Tock Binary Format
(using the `elf2tbf` utility):
`userland/examples/blink/build/cortex-m4/app.bin`.

Alternatively, pps can be built and automatically uploaded from the
Tock root directory:

```bash
$ make examples/blink
```

## Installing applications

Application binaries are programmed separately from the kernel.
Like the kernel, apps can be uploaded with `make program` or `make flash`.
```bash
$ cd userland/examples/blink/
$ make program
```

This builds and loads only a single app applications. Tock is capable
of running multiple applications concurrently. In order to load
multiple applications, you need to manually use the application upload
tools. They are located in `userland/tools/`, are separated by upload
method (`flash` or `program`) and take `.bin` files as input
arguments.

For example,

```bash
$ make -C userland/examples/blink
$ make -C userland/examples/c_hello
$ userland/tools/program/storm.py userland/examples/blink/build/cortex-m4/app.bin userland/examples/c_hello/build/cortex-m4/app.bin
```

will program both blink and c_hello on a storm board.

## Board-Specific Instructions

For instructions on building, uploading code, and debugging on specific
boards, see board specific READMEs.

 * [Storm](../boards/storm/README.md)
 * [nRF](../boards/nrf51dk/README.md)


## Formatting Rust Source Code

Rust includes a tool for automatically formatting Rust source
code. This requires a `cargo` tool:

    $ cargo install rustfmt

Then run:

    $ make format

to format the repository.
