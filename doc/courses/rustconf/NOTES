- loading more than 4 processes leads to kernel panic
  - could tockloader instead refuse in this case?

- note how to set permissions on USB device (e.g. udev rules)?

- python bins (like tockloader) sometimes not in path on
  certain distributions
  - $HOME/.local on linux
  - what on Mac?

- the sensors app can crash after awhile

- don't debug!() until the first interrupt?
