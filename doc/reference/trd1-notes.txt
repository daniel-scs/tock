# Suggestions for TRD1

3. TRD Structure

- Adopt markdown ordering of elements: title, header, body.

- Cite the authoritative description of markdown syntax:

3.1 Header

- Change header field "Author" to "Authors"
- Specify date format?

7. Author's Address

- Instead of non-standard triple-tics to format the address
  information, use a markdown "code block", which is a paragraph with
  every line indented by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab.

  (See: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#block)

8. Citations

- For hyperlinks, we could use markdown's built-in link syntax.  These
  links would then not appear in the Citation section when rendered as
  HTML.

- If the citation section contains no non-link elements (and would
  thus be rendered empty as HTML), it could be omitted.
